Project Scribe aims to be the world’s first fully autonomous book translator capable of translating whole works of literature from any language to another while capturing the full scope of the work’s literary meaning and depth. Combining our unique neural network architectures with state of the art advancements in natural language processing, Project Scribe aims to completely transform the translation and publication landscape with our revolutionary context retention mechanisms. Project Scribe also presents multiple other use cases such as providing instant translation to documents written in other languages or translating handwritten documents in other languages.

## The Tech:

Project Scribe is being developed using an encoder-decoder approach with multiple improvements upon existing translation techniques. The project implements a triple layer attention mechanism and a Generative Adversarial Neural Network in the decoder. The encoder-decoder mechanism is being developed using LSTMs.
